    <h1>PointyPoints Task Pointing</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to PointPoints task pointing, a server-less task pointing application/fun way to play with an application
      making use of WebSockets on the cheap. All server side functionality for this application is implemented via
      lambda's exposed through API Gateway. Dynamo is used for the data store. The front end is a Vue.js application
      stuffed into an S3 bucket and exposed to the world with CloudFront.
